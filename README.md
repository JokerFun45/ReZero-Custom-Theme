# Re:Zero Custom Theme
It's a theme of Re:Zero made by CreamCheese (C.C.) but I modified it to not show any explicit content.

The original theme by CreamCheese (C.C.) is here:

I honestly regret trying to change the background image from its original but it had to be done... (No offense to anyone that may offend)
The image may be easy to change in the coding (I.E. Changing 1 URL) but I made it take WAY longer than it should have by being picky of what image I wanted. If someone can figure out how to make it work then I'll be more than hppy to re-configure the whole thing again.

Here's the image I tried for:
